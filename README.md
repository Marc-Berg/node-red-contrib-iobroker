# Node-RED Nodes for ioBroker Integration

This repository provides custom Node-RED nodes for seamless integration with ioBroker via WebSocket communication.

## Features

- **Real-time WebSocket communication**
- **Shared connection management** - multiple nodes share WebSocket connections
- **Interactive state browser** with search functionality
- **Automatic reconnection** and connection status monitoring
- **Bidirectional communication** for state changes and commands
- **Object management** for accessing ioBroker object definitions

## Nodes

### iobin
**Input Node**  
Subscribes to ioBroker state changes and forwards updates to your flow in real-time.

- **State:** An ioBroker state can be specified using the interactive tree browser or manual input.
- **Output:** The value of the changed state is sent as `msg.[outputProperty]` (default: `msg.payload`).  
  The complete state object is available in `msg.state`.
- **Trigger on:** Filter state updates by acknowledgment status:
  - **Both:** All updates (default)
  - **Acknowledged:** Only updates with `ack: true`
  - **Unacknowledged:** Only updates with `ack: false`
- **Server Configuration:** Configure the ioBroker server details in the node settings.

### iobout
**Output Node**  
Sends values to ioBroker states.

- **State:** Specify the target ioBroker state using the tree browser or manual input.  
  If left empty, `msg.topic` is used as the state ID.
- **Input:** Any message with a value in `msg.[inputProperty]` (default: `msg.payload`) will update the specified state.
- **Set Mode:** Choose whether to set the value as a `value` (ack=true) or as a `command` (ack=false).
- **Server Configuration:** Configure the ioBroker server details in the node settings.

### iobget
**Getter Node**  
Reads the current value of an ioBroker state on demand.

- **State:** Specify the ioBroker state to read using the tree browser or manual input.  
  If left empty, `msg.topic` is used as state ID.
- **Output:** The current value of the state is sent as `msg.[outputProperty]` (default: `msg.payload`).
- **Server Configuration:** Configure the ioBroker server details in the node settings.

### iobgetobject
**Object Getter Node**  
Retrieves ioBroker object definitions, including metadata and configuration information.

- **Object ID:** Specify the ioBroker object identifier using the tree browser or manual input.  
  If left empty, `msg.topic` is used as object ID.
- **Output:** The complete object definition is sent as `msg.[outputProperty]` (default: `msg.payload`).
- **Object Structure:** Returns the full ioBroker object including type, common properties, native configuration, and access control information.
- **Server Configuration:** Configure the ioBroker server details in the node settings.

### iob-config
**Configuration Node**  
Shared configuration for ioBroker server settings.

- **ioBroker Host/Port:** Configure the ioBroker WebSocket endpoint.
- **Authentication:** Optional username/password for secured ioBroker installations.

## Installation

### Upload .tgz
- **Download the .tgz file** from the latest release (https://github.com/Marc-Berg/node-red-contrib-iobroker/releases) on GitHub.
- **Open your Node-RED editor.**
- **Go to the palette manager** (Menu â†’ "Manage palette").
- **Switch to the "Install" tab.**
- **Click on "Upload a .tgz file"** and select the downloaded .tgz file.
- **Wait for the installation to complete** and restart Node-RED if prompted.

## Usage

1. **Drag and drop** the nodes into your flow.
2. **Configure** the server settings in the `iob-config` node:
   - Enter the ioBroker host and port details.
   - Add authentication credentials if required.
3. **Configure** each node as needed:
   - Use the **interactive tree browser** to select states or objects, or enter them manually.
   - Set the output/input property for the value (default: `msg.payload`).
   - For `iobin`, select whether to trigger on all updates or only on acknowledged/unacknowledged changes.
   - For `iobout`, choose between "value" (ack=true) or "command" (ack=false) mode.
   - For `iobget` and `iobgetobject`, set the state or object ID or leave empty to use `msg.topic`.
4. **Connect** the nodes to your flow as needed.

## State Selection

All nodes feature an **interactive state browser** that makes it easy to find and select ioBroker states:

- **Manual input:** Type the state ID directly (e.g., `0_userdata.0.test`)
- **Tree browser:** Click "Switch to tree selection" to browse available states
- **Search functionality:** Use the search box to filter states in tree view
- **Smart caching:** State lists are cached for better performance
- **Real-time refresh:** Update the state list with the refresh button

## Object Management

The `iobgetobject` node provides access to ioBroker object definitions, which contain the structural and configuration information for all ioBroker entities. Object definitions include essential metadata such as object type classification (state, channel, device, adapter), common properties including names and roles, adapter-specific native configurations, and access control settings.

This functionality enables advanced automation scenarios that require inspection of object metadata, dynamic discovery of available devices and states, configuration validation and system monitoring, and integration with external systems that need detailed ioBroker structure information.

## Connection Management

The nodes use a **shared WebSocket connection manager** that provides:

- **Efficient resource usage:** Multiple nodes share connections to the same ioBroker server
- **Automatic reconnection:** Connections are automatically restored after network interruptions
- **Connection monitoring:** Real-time status updates for all nodes
- **Configuration change detection:** Automatic reconnection when server settings change

## Examples

- **Subscribe to state changes:** Use `iobin` to receive real-time updates from ioBroker.
- **Send values to ioBroker:** Use `iobout` to update ioBroker states (as value or command).
- **Read state values on demand:** Use `iobget` to query the current value of a state.
- **Inspect object definitions:** Use `iobgetobject` to retrieve metadata and configuration information for any ioBroker object.
- **Status monitoring:** Send `msg.topic = "status"` to any node to get connection information.

## WebSocket Connection

The nodes connect to ioBroker's WebSocket interface via one of three options:

- **WebSocket adapter** (default port 8084)
- **Web adapter** (default port 8082, requires "Use pure web-sockets (iobroker.ws)" to be enabled)
- **Admin adapter** (default port 8081)

Make sure that:

1. **One of the WebSocket-capable adapters is installed and running**
2. **The appropriate port is accessible** from your Node-RED instance
3. **Authentication is configured** if your ioBroker installation requires it

## Troubleshooting

If you experience connection issues:

1. **Check WebSocket adapters:** 
   - **WebSocket adapter (8084):** Ensure it's installed via `iobroker add ws` and running
   - **Web adapter (8082):** Ensure it's installed via `iobroker add web` and running
   - **Admin adapter (8081):** Ensure it's installed via `iobroker add admin` and running
2. **Verify network connectivity:** Test if the chosen port is reachable from Node-RED
3. **Check authentication:** Verify username/password if authentication is enabled in ioBroker
4. **Review logs:** Check both Node-RED debug logs and ioBroker logs for error messages
5. **Use status monitoring:** Send status messages to nodes to check connection health
6. **Try alternative ports:** If one port doesn't work, try the other WebSocket options
